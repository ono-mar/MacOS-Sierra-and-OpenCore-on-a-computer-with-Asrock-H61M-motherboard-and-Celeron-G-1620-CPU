# MacOS-Sierra-and-OpenCore-on-a-computer-with-Asrock-H61M-motherboard-and-Celeron-G-1620-CPU
Sierra with Bootloader Clover works very well. But I want to do the same thing using OpenCore
I created a bootable stick and put Opencore 0.5.9 on it.
I used the directions from GitHub for the Ivy Bridge version and the directions for switching from Clover to OpenCore, but something is wrong. From the logfile I find that I get stuck at "SmcReadValue Key 4D535463 Size 1 and SmcReadValue Key 4D534163 Size 2." But until then, the messages are all marked with "Success", which is why I don't understand anything anymore.
Last message ": Prelinked status - Success". I also attach the EFI folder.
