Sierra with Bootloader Clover works very well. But I want to do the same thing using OpenCore
I used GitHub directions for IvY Bridge, and those for switching from Clover to OpenCore.
In the "logfile" it shows that I am stuck at "SmcReadValue Key 4D535463 Size 1 and SmcReadValue Key 4D534163 Size 2".
But until then, the messages are all marked with "Success", which is why I don't understand anything anymore.
Last message ": Prelinked status - Success". I also attach the EFI folder. I'm stuck, because I can't find an explanation for this message. Is there an indication somewhere, how to proceed?
